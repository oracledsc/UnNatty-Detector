# UnNatty Detector v1.4

UnNatty Detector is a tool designed to analyze the memory of processes and detect any anomalies, including hooks or altered `discord_voice.node` files. It provides insights into potential tampering and aids in identifying suspicious behavior.

## Features

### 1. Hook Detection
- Scans the memory of the loaded `discord_voice.node` process.
- Detects Address-Of-Byte (AOB) changes and abnormal Assembly (ASM) code.
- Alerts when hooks are found and logs them for further analysis.

### 2. Process History Inspection
- Tracks the process history to detect patterns of injection or suspicious activity.
- Analyzes process creation and termination behaviors for irregularities.

### 3. Byte Comparison
- Compares the file size of the loaded `discord_voice.node` with the latest official version.
- Identifies outdated or potentially tampered files.

### 4. Detailed Logging
- Generates a `logs.txt` file with:
  - Details on detected hooks.
  - Anomalies in memory.
  - Process history for manual inspection.
- Useful for advanced debugging and verification.

### 5. User-Friendly Alerts
- Displays warnings such as:
  ```
  Hook detected! Analyze `logs.txt` for more information.
  ```
- Provides a fallback message:
  ```
  No hooks detected, but this doesn't guarantee safety. Check `logs.txt` and review process history.
  ```

   - If no hook is detected, the tool will say so but advise checking the `logs.txt` file manually.
   - The `logs.txt` file includes:
     - Process list: Helps identify suspicious processes like Abaddon or hooks.
     - Voice node details: Includes file size, offsets, etc., to verify against the latest Discord voice node.
     - More Infos if a hook has been detected.
